I am a Master's student in Hydrology at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), advised by [Advisor Name]. I am currently a joint-training student at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Third Pole Environment and Big Data Center).

I received my Bachelor's degree (ranked 1/259,保研资格) in Geographic Information Science at Xi'an University of Science and Technology, where I graduated with honors as an Outstanding Graduate with an Outstanding Thesis.

**Goal:** Apply deep reinforcement learning to solve complex problems in human-earth systems.

**Research Interest:** The intersection of deep reinforcement learning, earth system science, and hyperspectral image processing.

**Research Question:** How can we leverage deep reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making trajectories in complex human-earth coupled systems for sustainable environmental management?

**Passion:** I am passionate about using AI and data-driven approaches to address critical challenges in geosciences and environmental systems.
