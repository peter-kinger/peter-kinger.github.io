## Abstract

This paper proposes CoDenNet (Coupled Dense Convolutional Network), an unsupervised deep learning approach for hyperspectral image super-resolution reconstruction. By coupling dense convolutional layers with an autoencoder architecture, our method achieves superior performance in reconstructing high-resolution hyperspectral images from low-resolution inputs.

## Key Contributions

* Developed an unsupervised learning framework for hyperspectral super-resolution
* Integrated dense convolutional networks with autoencoder for feature extraction
* Achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets
* Presented at ICIG 2023 conference
